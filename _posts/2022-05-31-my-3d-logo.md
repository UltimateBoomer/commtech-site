I made an animated 3D logo in Blender. Here is the result.

## Description

This is my Youtube logo animation. It involves a buildup that ends with a direct shot of the 3D logo. The logo itself consists of the channel name “UB gaming” (stands for UltimateBoomer gaming), and two other figures placed on a framed cube. When I first conceptualized what the logo will be about, I thought to make it related to science and technology. However, in the end, I chose gaming as the primary theme as it lines up better with my interests.

## Behind The Scenes

### Planning and Designing

To design the logo, I initially created a rough model to use as reference. I based the final design on the model, but with some changes such as pixelated text.

For the animation, I made a short storyboard for the logo animation.

### Images Used

Other than the “UB gaming” text, I based the logo on two other images. The first is the CD-i ganon face, which is recognizable as one of the earliest memes on Youtube. The second is the Big Chungus, the rotund Bugs Bunny that captured the internet in late 2018. 

### 3D Modeling

To make the logo, I created a 3D model of my design idea in Blender.

The logo is split into several parts, including the glowing interior, the frame, and the text/figures on the outside. I modeled each of these elements using what I learned from my tutorials in Blender 3D modelling. 

I made use of various Blender modifiers, in particular Remesh that recreates a model using pixelated blocks. I chose this style to relate the logo more towards gaming.

I feel like I could’ve done better in this step of the production process; if I spent more time on 3D modeling, I could have made the logo a little bit more involved than just a spinning cube.

### Materials and Shading

The bulk of my time went into tinkering with materials and shading, in order to make the logo look smooth and satisfying after being rendered.

The logo is made of two materials, one for the interior and the other for the exterior. The interior material is supposed to look like lava, which is made using noise textures. The exterior material is designed to look like some form of metal. My original plan for the lighting is to have spotlights point towards the logo. In the product, I used a glowing interior to better accentuate the outer parts of the logo using contrast, in tandem with the purple and green spotlight. This setup combines the three secondary colors of RYB to light the logo.

Overall, I spent a lot of effort messing with how each materials should look like, and I think it was not a wasted effort.

### Animation

I chose 60 fps as the framerate of the animation as if I am to make Youtube videos about gameplay, they’re very likely going to be recorded in 60 fps. The animation process took several attempts to get right. Although the animation looks simple at a glance, there is a lot of details in the background I had to get right for the logo to look good.

For example, I made the interior glow very bright at the beginning of the animation to make the subtle rays coming out of the logo visible. I then dimmed the light over time so that the interior looks detailed once the logo slows down. At the same time, I tweaked the timing of the logo buildup so that the sliding animation looks smooth, and it was a more time consuming process than I thought.

For the camera movement, I originally intended to have the camera rotate around the logo, but I opted to have the logo rotate instead so the background is not distracting. Similar to the donut animation, I added a subtle depth of field effect so that the it is easier for the eye to focus of the logo.

Lastly, the particles was a lot easier to make and looked far cleaner than I thought. I basically took the same idea from the confetti in the donut tutorial, and changed some implementations. Instead of translating the particles, I opted for rotating them along a line instead, which creates a slightly different effect but works very well in this animation.


### Final Render and Sound

For the final render, I added some compositor effects like motion blur, lens dispersion and brightness/contrast adjustment to improve the looks of the animations. To optimize render times, I localized the volume effect to a sphere around the logo instead of the entire scene world. I also adjusting the sampling amount accordingly to speed up rendering speed. The full render took about 1 hour and 40 minutes for a 310 frame animation.
After the render is done, I sequenced the individual frames together using Blender’s built in video editor, and added sound effects to accompany the animation. Unfortunately, I found the Blender video editing to be very lackluster on its functions, so there isn’t any fancy effects I can use for making the final product look and sound better other than sound panning. The sound effects used are all public domain samples from freesound.org, which I modified with Audacity. As a last minute addition, I made a short music track with LMMS (digital audio workstation) and incorporated it into the video. 


### Conclusion

Overall, I’m happy with the product of the Youtube intro project, though there is plenty of room for improvement. The rotation and slide in animation are all very smooth, and the sounds used fit the animation to a decent effect. However, there could have been more nuance to the product. As an example, I could have made the logo look more intricate than just simple a cube, and maybe a fade out animation could have been added. Even though I had only 2 weeks to work on the project, I learned a lot about the standard workflows of Blender, and focused on what is important to make the final project.

Reflecting back to the tutorials I’ve done, I used most of the techniques I learned in basic 3D modeling, though I did not use sculpting since I was not working with an organic object. For texturing, I did not use texture painting as the materials I used are mostly homogenous, though I still used the noise texture approach to create the dynamically changing  materials. I used geometry nodes to created the ember particles similar to what I’ve done in my tutorial project. For animation, I used pretty much everything I’ve learned there for my logo. Lastly, the Audacity tutorial helped me in editing sound effects to fit in the animation.

If I am to do the project again, I would focus more towards 3D modeling aspects of the design and push myself to add more detail to the animation.
