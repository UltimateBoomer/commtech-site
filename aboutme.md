My name is Steven Cao. I am currently a high school student at Bluevale CI, in Waterloo, Ontario. Next year, I will be studying Computer Science at University of Waterloo, and in the future I hope to become a software developer if I don't find the job boring. 

My main interests lie in programming and learning how hardware works. I've scratched the surface on some of the common languages like C++, Python and Java. I'm definately most familar with Java since I've worked on Minecraft modding for some years. Otherwise, I've created several coding projects such as an OpenGL mandelbrot viewer and a Penrose rhobus tiling pattern generator powered by Matplotlib. I also love tweaking and overclocking hardware.

My recent works are several Minecraft mods that focuses on simple improvements to the performance and function to the game. Check out my [Curseforge]() and [Modrinth]() profiles to browse and download the mods I've made. All my mods are open-source with MIT license, so if you want to use parts of my code or to improve it, feel free to do so. 

Aside from programming, I have done works in communication technology. This includes working in Blender for 3D modeling and animation, using Davinci Resolve to edit videos, and using Unreal Engine 5 to create maps. You can check out the write-ups of my projects in my blog posts.
