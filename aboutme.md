My name is Steven Cao. I am currently a high school student at Bluevale CI, in Waterloo, Ontario. I have gotten into University of Waterloo's Computer Science program, and am aspiring to become a general software developer.

My recent works are several Minecraft mods that focuses on simple improvements to the performance and function to the game.

Aside from programming, I have done works in communication technology. You can check out my projects with the navbar.
